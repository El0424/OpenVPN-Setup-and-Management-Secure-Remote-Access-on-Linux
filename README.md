## Overview

This project provides a complete guide to setting up and managing an OpenVPN server on a Linux system, using EasyRSA for robust certificate and key management. OpenVPN is a widely-used, open-source VPN solution that offers secure, encrypted remote access to networks. EasyRSA simplifies the management of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) necessary for a secure VPN setup. This guide covers installation, configuration, and management of an OpenVPN server, along with instructions for setting up client devices.

## Features

- **Secure and Encrypted Remote Access: Provides a fully encrypted tunnel for secure remote access to internal network resources.**
- **Certificate Management with EasyRSA: Utilizes EasyRSA to streamline the creation, renewal, and revocation of server and client certificates for enhanced security.**
- **Cross-Platform Client Support: Includes setup instructions for OpenVPN clients on various platforms, such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and mobile devices.**
- **Firewall and Security Integration: Integrates with Linux firewall settings to control and monitor traffic, ensuring only authorized connections access the VPN.**

## Tools and Technologies
- **OpenVPN: Open-source VPN solution for secure and encrypted network access.**
- **EasyRSA: Command-line utility for managing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and generating certificates and keys.**
- **Linux: Operating system for hosting the OpenVPN server (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).**
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall): Firewall management tool to control and monitor network traffic (for Ubuntu users).**
- **iptables: Low-level firewall utility for managing packet filtering and NAT (for Linux distributions that donâ€™t use UFW).**
- **OpenSSL: Toolkit for cryptography, used by EasyRSA for creating secure certificates and encryption.**
